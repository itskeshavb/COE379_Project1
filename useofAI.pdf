     Prompt: My code keeps crashing when I run a grid search. How can I improve it.
     Output:
        Step 1: Limit Grid Search Scope
        You donâ€™t need to search every possible hyperparameter.
        For KNN, the most impactful parameters are usually
        from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
        from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

        param_grid = {
            'n_neighbors': [3, 5, 7, 9],
            'weights': ['uniform', 'distance']
        }

        knn = KNeighborsClassifier()
        grid = GridSearchCV(knn, param_grid, cv=3, n_jobs=-1, verbose=1)
        grid.fit(X_train, y_train)
        Step 2: You can run grid search on a subset of the data, then retrain the best model on the full dataset.
        Ex:
            # Sample data for grid search
            X_small = X_train_scaled[:20000]
            y_small = y_train[:20000]
            best_knn = KNeighborsClassifier(**grid.best_params_)
            best_knn.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
